Our destination this time was famous **Wilsons Promontary National Park** which is a beautiful coastal wilderness area in southernmost part of Australian mainland. On our way to Wilsons Prom, we stayed one night in **Foster**. 

### Foster

Foster is a remote, rural city which is located about one hour drive away from Wilsons Prom. At first sight, we loved Foster very much for its serenity and simplicity. The local community was very nice and friendly and ready to welcome new visitors to Foster very warmly. Though it is a small town, it had all the basic necessities concentrated within the town centre.
**Pearl Park** in Foster was a nice and quiet place to spend the time th so many colorful Tulips at the entrance which was very pleasing.

### Wilsons Promontary National Park

Next Morning, we set off to Wilsons Prom National Park. The road to Wilsons Prom from Foster was very scenic too with lots of green meadows and cattle and sheep farms. Wilsons Prom actually was a treasury of so many nice and clean beaches and a range of beautiful mountains , ideal for hiking. Unique landscapes and surrounding beauty of Wilsons Prom are something that never to be forgotten.
**Squeaky Beach and Tidal river** were two popular tourist attractions. The Squeaky beach has got its name because it makes a funny squeaky sound when people walk on it.
However,apart from squeaky beach and tidal river,  there are not many places that you can explore in there, if you have little ones, because most of the areas can only be reached by a few Kilometers of walk along the tracks.

### Toora Wind Farm

On our way back, we decided to visit the Toora Wind Farm. The giant wind turbines were amazing at a closer look up and were happy to witness such an eco friendly, alternative energy system for our future. Children would find this place very important for education purposes too.

### Stunning **Sillockhill road** Lookout

On the way to Toora wind farm via Sillockhill road was the scenic lookout. Truly amazing and spectacular views and I think this is a must visit lookout if you are travelling on this route.

### Agnes Falls

When we continued further up the same road passing the wind farm, there was famous Agnes falls and reserve. The waterfall was a very beautiful one cascading through many levels. Again, this I think is a must see place, if you are a nature lover and want to have a nice walk and spend some time near a lovely waterfall.
