It has been raining during the whole week in the area where we live and so we desperately wanted a getaway to a sunnier, warmer place where the children could play and enjoy. We checked the weather app and found that though  so many other towns were having the same rainy, gloomy weather, Bendigo was full of sunshine. That made our decision and Just in a few minutes time, we set off to Bendigo. 

**Bendigo** , which is located about 150 Km north west of Melbourne, inherits a very rich history since the discovery of gold mines during 1850s. Even today , we could evidence the golden past of Bendigo through the beautifully architectured buildings , magnificent churches, carefully planned city and the remains of the gold mines.

### Bendigo Talking Tramways 

This was one of the unique experiences we had in Bendigo. We spent about an hour riding on a beautifully crafted, refurbished tram. While on the move, we could listen to the story of Bendigo, how it was evolved during the gold rush past. The tram stopped near all the major monuments of the city and explained about each. Home like atmosphere inside the tram helped us to relax well and enjoy the ride through the city.

### Weerona Lake Park

This was our favourite place to spend the time with nature. Lake Weerona was very picturesque and me and my family went for a walk around the lake enjoying its beauty and viewing many different kinds of birds and ducks near by. Playground at the corner of the park is well equipped and will definitely be loved by the little ones. We couldn't go there as it was already over crowded. If you become hungry and need refreshments, there's a fine dining restaurant too, just around the corner.

### Sacred Heart Cathedral

That was magnificent , the most amazing cathedral that I've seen so far. Visitors can go inside it and view all the astonishing paintings, structures and statues.

### Bendigo Botanic Gardens

We went only to the children's playground in here as the time did not permit us to explore the whole botanic garden. Playground was designed according to the theme "Alice in Wonderland". Not necessary to say how much it is loved by the little ones to explore the secret gardens, secret mirrors, music push buttons and many other special designs to keep themselves entertained and thrilled all through out the park. Had a wonderful time there with lots of joy and smiles.

However, we could not visit many other attractions of beautiful Bendigo, such as **Rosalind Park**, **Deborah Gold mines**, **Golden Dragon Museum** etc, as this was a day trip. That will make my promise to return to Bendigo once again for a stay of few days, to explore and live it even better.
