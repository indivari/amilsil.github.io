It's amazing how such a tiny town has so much to share with its visitors. You would feel the same if you visit Kilcunda, which is a tiny coastal town situated about 117Km away from Melbourne CBD and it is very close to famous Phillip Island tourist destination as well. This  small town is nice and calm with a small community and its town center has a few shops to cater the essential needs of visitors.

### The Beaches

Kilcunda, which is rich in nature has three main  beautiful beaches, the main beach which is near the caravan park, surf beach near the  ancient Trestle bridge and Shelly beach. We found that those beaches were not crowded and ideal for the whole family to enjoy the seaside leisurely away from the hustle and bustle of a typical busy beach. There was also a good children's playground overlooking the beautiful beach near the main beach, perfect for the kids who want some extra activities to keep them busy after playing at the beach.

### Rock Pools

We went to the ***Surf Beach*** and there was a large area of natural rock pools. The unique rock formations, patterns,colours and various sea creatures that live in them, all created a world full of exploration and fun especially for my little ones.

### Coastal rail trail

The best thing about Kilcunda, which I liked very much was its lovely set of long ***coastal walks***, along the beach, over a tressel bridge and over some cliffs with breathtaking panoramic views on the sea and surrounding area. We were lucky to walk along the this trail at the golder hour just before sunset, which made it even more amazingly beautiful. 

I must say, we have enjoyed our tour to Kilcunda a lot. I hope you all would like it too, if serene beaches, lovely coastal walks and spectacular views are what you are looking forward to experience.
