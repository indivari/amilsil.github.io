Hello again. One memorable year has just ended and after an year long pause from  my travel blog posts, mainly because we were busy with  welcoming another  new baby to our family, 
here I go again about   our favourite family  trips.

If there is one place  that  my kids would love to   travel endlessly, that would be the   sea side. So once again, on this beautiful summer morning, it was their suggestion to go to the  beach. As a fresh start to the new year with new hopes and  dreams, we chose the famouse  **Cowes** beach in   Phillip Island in Melbourne, Australia.

It was just a little more than one  hour drive from  our home and  we could  witness the breath taking views of beautiful Phillip Island with  the amazingly  blue ocean and green hills and cliffs.

**Cowes** beach is located at the northern boundary of  Phillip Island and Cowes town is a small but well stuffed town with many restaurants ,cafes, super markets and all other necessities to cater the needs of its local residents and
visitors.

As this is the  summer holiday season in Australia, we expected a bit of an overly crowded beach, but luckily, the long stretch of  Cowes beach was spacious enough to accomodate many people without being   congested. 

Clean, shallow and clear waters at Cowes beach  is perfect for water play and bathing even for small kids. Moreover, the  beach is   clear from rocks and   rock pools, hence  it makes a  safer place for kids to walk and run. My kids loved treasure hunting in the beache and were able collect so many beautiful sea shells to take home. It was really  pleasing to   see them  playing around and making   sand castles with lots of smiles and giggle.

Further, for those who fancy a boat ride around the   Cowes beach , there's a jetty from where they can  hop on to a boat to explore the sea side.


### Foreshore Reserve

Cowes beach , unlike many other beaches, has a beautifully grown, well maintained, foreshore reserve  along the beach, where there are plenty of large trees to shade and grass to sit on and relax. This was what I really loved about this beach and  actually I spent most of the   time relaxing   under the shade with my five months old baby, while  watching  my older kids playing at the   beach with my husband.

Like always, well  refreshed and capturing another beautiful memory to cherish upon, we said good byes to the lovely Cowes beach, thinking it would be nice to come back here again for a night stay one day.
